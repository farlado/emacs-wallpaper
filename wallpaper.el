;;; Commentary:

;; Ricing `exwm' is pretty cool, but even cooler is being able to manage
;; everything about your rice using Emacs.  This package is meant to
;; make that a little bit easier, by managing your wallpapers for you.
;;
;; The provided modes are `wallpaper-cycle-mode' for cycling randomly
;; through wallpapers in a directory, and `wallpaper-per-workspace-mode'
;; for setting a specific wallpaper or wallpapers in each workspace or
;; a window manager.
;;
;; The following window managers are known to work with this package:
;; - EXWM
;; - Any that use vdesk for virtual desktops
;;
;; The following might work but aren't fully tested:
;; - i3
;;
;; Compatibility is only guaranteed with use of an X desktop session.

;; In my opinion this should be named `wallpaper-set-random-wallpaper'.  Seeing
;; this I would think that this is an interactive function to choose the
;; wallpaper.  In fact, even reading the doc-string would make me thing that
;; because it just says "set the wallpaper".  It should at least say "set random
;; wallpaper".

;; It's a matter of opinion whether by "set a random wallpaper" the user means
;; set a random wallpaper that's not the current one.  To be honest that's what
;; I mean when I say that.  I mean why would I even call this command if I'm
;; O.K. with the same wallpaper?

;; This monitor stuff is confusing me.  I think it's makes things more
;; complicated than what its worth.  I don't use multiple monitors but if I did
;; would I really want to change all their wallpapers at the same time?

;; Also I'm not such a fan of the functionality of
;; `wallpaper--random-wallpapers' relative to its name.  By reading the name I
;; would think it gives me a list of random wallpapers from the available
;; wallpapers; but instead it gives me a random wallpaper for each monitor.  I
;; feel that "monitor" should be in its name if it's a monitor specific
;; function.

;; Surprisingly, there's no interactive function to actually choose a wallpaper.
;; I feel that this is a basic thing that should be here.

;; Choose a wallpaper.  I don't completely understand how there are multiple
;; wallpapers in `wallpaper-set-wallpapers'.  Aren't we just setting one?  The
;; current monitor's?  In any case, I'll follow the idiom.
