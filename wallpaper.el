;;; Commentary:

;; Ricing `exwm' is pretty cool, but even cooler is being able to manage
;; everything about your rice using Emacs.  This package is meant to
;; make that a little bit easier, by managing your wallpapers for you.
;;
;; The provided modes are `wallpaper-cycle-mode' for cycling randomly
;; through wallpapers in a directory, and `wallpaper-per-workspace-mode'
;; for setting a specific wallpaper or wallpapers in each workspace or
;; a window manager.
;;
;; The following window managers are known to work with this package:
;; - EXWM
;; - Any that use vdesk for virtual desktops
;;
;; The following might work but aren't fully tested:
;; - i3
;;
;; Compatibility is only guaranteed with use of an X desktop session.
